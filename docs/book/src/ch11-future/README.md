# Future Directions

Roadmap, vision, and how to contribute to aspect-rs.

## What We've Achieved

- ✅ Basic macro weaving
- ✅ Production pointcuts + 8 standard aspects
- ✅ Automatic weaving
- ✅ **9,100+ lines** of production code
- ✅ **108+ tests** passing
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation**

## Short-Term Roadmap (3-6 months)

1. Stabilize automatic weaving
2. Add field access interception
3. Improve pointcut expression language
4. Better IDE support (rust-analyzer integration)
5. More standard aspects (10+ total)

## Long-Term Vision (1-2 years)

1. Call-site interception (match where functions are called)
2. Advanced pointcuts (cflow, args matching)
3. Aspect libraries ecosystem
4. Zero-cost abstractions proof (formal verification)
