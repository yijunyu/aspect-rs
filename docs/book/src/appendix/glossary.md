# Appendix A: Glossary

## Aspect
A module that encapsulates a crosscutting concern. Implements the `Aspect` trait.

## Join Point
A point in program execution where an aspect can be applied (e.g., function call).

## Pointcut
A predicate that selects which join points an aspect applies to.

## Advice
Code that runs at a join point (before, after, around, after_throwing).

## Weaving
The process of inserting aspect code into join points at compile time.

See [AOP Terminology](../ch02-background/terminology.md) for detailed explanations.
